Welcome to my repository for the Machine Intelligence Systems project at Full Sail University. This project received a score of 100, reflecting a comprehensive understanding and application of machine learning algorithms to analyze the survival of passengers on the Titanic.

Project Overview:

The objective of this assignment was to solidify the understanding of machine learning algorithms by applying them to a real-world dataset. The dataset in focus is the Titanic dataset, which contains information about the passengers and their survival status.

Repository Content:

    Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):
        Initial exploration of the dataset to understand the distribution of variables, identify outliers, and discover patterns that could influence survival rates.
    Data Processing:
        Cleaning and preprocessing of the dataset to handle missing values, encode categorical variables, and feature scaling to prepare the data for training.
    Model Training:
        Experimentation with various machine learning models to find the one that provides the best predictions on the survival status of the passengers.
    Model Validation:
        Employed different validation techniques to ensure the robustness and reliability of the selected model.
    Technique Summaries:
        A comprehensive summary of all the techniques and methodologies applied during the project, emphasizing the continuous learning and application of new techniques discussed in class.
    Visualizations:
        Various visualizations showcasing the data distribution, model performance, and insights derived from the analysis.
    Final Report:
        A detailed report discussing the entire process, findings, and visualizations, providing a clear understanding of the steps taken and the rationale behind them.

Technologies Used:

    Python
    Scikit-learn
    Pandas
